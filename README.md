## Social Media Authentication

The RMIT appointing scheduling application allows external authentication to utilize student and staff features. In our case we are currently using the Google+ API to authenticate users using the **OAuth2** protocol.

### Advantages & disadvantages offered by a social media login instead of the local login

Using a social media login provides security through the reliability of the social networking site and its infrastructure. They have the sole responsibility of storing the users confidential credentials.

Applications using the authentication mode will not need to store any passwords in the database. Credentials stored on a large organization such as Google or Microsoft would most likely have multiple points of failure compared to a simple application where credentials can lose its integrity.

A downside to having social media login would be that the user must have the account required from the social media provider. For example, if an application only has OAuth2 authentication for Google then the user must login an existing account or register a new account with Google. Additionally, applications tend to store any information scoped by the social media provider such as emails and full names, which means there would be a larger spread of the users information across the application and the provider.
